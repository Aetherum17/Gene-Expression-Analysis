# Gene Expression Analysis

# INTRODUCTION:
Gene expression analysis is an extremely important step in many biological and clinical studies since it allows scientists to find similarities and differences in the transcriptome of cells, as well as to some extent in their genome and proteome. Those findings open up opportunities to study a variety of cellular 
processes and diseases that may arise from their disorders. Thereby, for this assignment, we are asked to 
analyze RNA expression in the cloned subline of neuroblastoma cells and to interpret the results. On the 
basis of the processed data, we are also kindly asked to propose additional experiments that can be carried 
out for a deeper and more detailed study of this cell lineage in particular and of the disease in general.

The performed quality control has highlighted the fact that some genes in the same experiment time were 
expressing differently, as can be seen looking at the clustered Heatmap below for gene 234487 when 
comparing two controls, gene 280518 when comparing cells at 1 Hour, gene 274442 when comparing cells 
at 24 Hours et cetera.
